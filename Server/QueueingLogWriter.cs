    /// Queueing design here intended to prevent file I/O from blocking

    /// connections, and we don't want to slow them down.

    /// This class has a few shared resources that it must synchronize:
    /// - The hash set used to enforce uniqueness of values we write.
    /// - The underlying queue.
    /// 
    /// Uses manual reset event (<c>_workerSignal</c>) to let the worker
    /// thread rest when there are no items on the queue. When new items
    /// are added, it gets signaled and picks back up again.
